                <h2>PROJECTS</h2>
                <h3 id="_1year">1st Year</h3>
                <div id="_1year_subjects">
                    <h4>IUS</h4>
                    <p>Only one project. Objective of the project is to create Use case, ER diagram for information system</p>
                    <h4>IZP</h4>
                    <p>Huge project which will test basic knowledge of C language. Knowledge like memory allocation, pointers, structures and other basic building blocks of the language</p>
                    <h4>IEL</h4>
                    <p>Project is based on calculating few exercises where knoledge is gained during the study of this subject.</p>
                    <h4>INC</h4>
                    <p>Hardware subject, so the project is based on hardware language called VHDL. The project itself is not hard but people tend to dislike hardware languages in general.</p>
                    <h4>IOS</h4>
                    <p>2 projects. One in bash, which is usually for filtering data from files and second one is in C where you have to use fork for doing multiple tasks.</p>
                </div>
                <h3 id="_2year">2nd Year</h3>
                <div id="_2year_subjects">
                    <h4>IPT</h4>
                    <p>Project consists of multiple statistics exercises which will test knowledge gained during the study of the subject. Exercises range from easy to really hard ones.</p>
                    <h4>ISS</h4>
                    <p>One project which will usually be about signal processing. This one can be really fun.</p>
                    <h4>INP</h4>
                    <p>Another hardware subject which has 2 projects. FIrst one was in esoteric language called Brainf*ck and we had to do program for deciphering. Other project was in VHDL where we had to get our login printed.</p>
                    <h4>IFJ</h4>
                    <p>Really huge and complex group project where the aim is to create compiler which will work by the assignment.</p>
                    <h4>IAL</h4>
                    <p>2 projects. Aim of both is to implement multiple algorithm methods like methods over list, BVS or queues</p>
                    <h4>IZG</h4>
                    <p>Project which might be hard for some because it is about graphics and that is math and a lot of matrixes. Aim is to generate specific enviroment</p>
                    <h4>IZU</h4>
                    <p>4 small project in Prolog language. They are really short so one doesn't spend too much time on them. On are literally one liners.</p>
                    <h4>IDS</h4>
                    <p>Throughout this subject you work on project and submit it at 3 stages. First one is scheme, then basic database with basic filtering operations and then complex stuff like triggers, procedures etc.</p>
                    <h4>IPK</h4>
                    <p>Subject consists of 2 projects where you have to create client at first one and then server at second one. You are free to use C, C#, C++ or Common Lisp.</p>
                    <h4>IPP</h4>
                    <p>Whole subject is about objected oriented programming however the first project can be done without it. In the first one you have to create script for generating XML file for interpreter. Second project is much more harder because you have to implement said interpreter.</p>
                </div>
                <h3 id="_3year">3rd Year</h3>
                <div id="_3year_subjects">
                    <h4>IIS</h4>
                    <p>Another group complex project. You have to create information system, its frontend, backend and database. You are free to use any programming languages.</p>
                    <h4>IMS</h4>
                    <p>Only one project and can be done in group of 2. Aim is to model and simulate for example company and how they operate and find what they can cut or change to earn more money. It's done with SIMLIB library created in C.</p>
                    <h4>IMP</h4>
                    <p>Last of the hardware languages. One project that is connected to doing with some hardware equipment. One of the examples is create basic Snake-like game</p>
                    <h4>ISA</h4>
                    <p>Multiple different assignment done in C or C++. Some are easier than others.</p>
                    <h4>ITU</h4>
                    <p>You can heaviy reuse your project from IIS here because it's frontend what matters here.</p>

                <div id="music">
                    <p>As I mentioned in the about me section, I really like music. I listen to it daily and even during making of this site. It kind of heals my soul and helps me through the tough times. I don't listen to specific genre. My most favourite song is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GsF05B8TFWg">Axwell /\ Ingrosso - More Than You Know</a></p>
                </div>
                <div id="driving">
                    <p>One of my other passions is driving a car. I was fascinated by cars since i was child. I would even call myself car enthusiast. I know quite some stuff about cars. My dream car is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodge_Challenger">Dodge Challenger</a> and i hope that i will be able to on it someday. Currently i own Volkswagen Passat '11 which is great car and gets me everywhere i need. However driving didn't go around without any accidents but they were mostly fender benders so nothing serious and mostly not caused by me.</p>

                <div id="dancing">
                    <p>One of the interests that was huge part of my life was Ballroom dancing. I started as 7 years old and did it till my 18th birthday. I really hope that i will be able to start again, not competitively though because that is financially and time-consuming. I was on multiple competitions throughout whole Slovakia and even here in Brno.</p>
